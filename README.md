This is my personal portfolio, styled like a messy notebook and built to feel playful instead of template-ty. 

See it here -> [https://hannahsong.space/](https://hannahsong.space/)

## What’s inside
- A hand-drawn, sketchbook-style layout
- Sections for about, resume, projects, and photos
- A shared drawing board where anyone can doodle!!
  - Pick colors and brush sizes
  - Erase, clear, and save drawings
  - Publish drawings to the gallery

## Built with
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Fabric.js for the drawing canvas
- lucide-react for icons

Nothing super fancy unfortunately, maybe in the future??

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
